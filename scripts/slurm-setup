# slurm-setup - Share common configuration between all STUDENT-SIDE scripts.
#
# Environment variables that are intended to be used by the SETILab scripts
# directly should be prepended with "SETI_". Say you wanted all SETI scripts to
# have access to a "FOOBAR" environment variable, it should be named
# "SETI_FOOBAR". Note that this is only a convention and we have no way of
# actually enforcing this.

# sbatch actually has 2 parts: (1) salloc - allocate & populate Slurm's job
# structures, (2) use the provided script as a batch job template and run it.
# If salloc fails to allocate a job, then sbatch & salloc return 1. If a student
# attempt to submit a job that violates the limits & QoS we set for the students,
# then salloc will fail to allocate a job structure for them.
