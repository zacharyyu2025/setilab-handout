Setilab Student README - Kyle C. Hale 2014, Karl Hallsby 2024

GETTING STARTED:

To see how to use any of the provided utilities, run the program with no arguments (you can
also typically use the -h flag)

You first want to get a signal from the server:

./siggen -n netid1-netid2 -t "teamname"

This will create several files for you. Some signals (named sig-N.bin, where N ranges from 0 to
however many signals we decide to give you) and secret. sig-N.bin files are your radio signal data. The secret file you
will use with the seti-eval and seti-handin scripts. You will also generate the netids and teamname file, to more easily
remember the exact names and netids you used.

To analyze signals, you will mostly be using the programs band_scan, amdemod, bin2wav, and analyze_signal.

Read the lab handout for further details on how to proceed from there.
